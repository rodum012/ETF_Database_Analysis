In order to launch the application, navigate to the ETF_Database_Anlysis folder that contains all of the code for this application, and then type into the command line:

```
jupyter lab
```

Once in jupyter lab, open the etf_analyzer.ipynb file and run each cell in the jupyter file to see the resulting anlysis. All of the resulting graphs can then be visualized in a variety of ways by using the tools on the right hand side of the graph.

Below is a screen recording taken of the resulting outputs of each cell displayed on a webpage using voila :
